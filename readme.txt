There's 2 folders:
code
results


------------------------
The folder "code" includes the GitHub branch with the two Jupyter Notebooks and instructions on how to run them.

The folder "results" includes the test MSEs, the positional and rotational errors for each of the 13 datasets as presented in the paper. Weights have been omitted for dimensionality constraint, but they are available upon request to the authors.

loss = loss with CGAPoseNet+GCAN
NB_loss = loss with CGAPoseNet without bottleneck
OG_loss = loss with original CGAPoseNet
