**Geometry-Aware Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks**  

## 📌 Introduction
We introduce **CGAPoseNet+GCAN**, an enhanced version of **CGAPoseNet** for camera pose regression from RGB images. By incorporating a **Geometric Clifford Algebra Network (GCAN)**, we create a geometry-aware pipeline that improves pose estimation accuracy while reducing computational overhead. 

### 🔹 Key Features
- **Unified Representation:** Uses Clifford Geometric Algebra to model camera poses as **motors**, integrating quaternions and translation vectors into a single mathematical object.
- **No Extra Scene Information Needed:** Achieves competitive results **without** requiring 3D point clouds or expensive loss function tuning.
- **Geometry-Aware Learning:** GCAN refines motor proposals generated by an **InceptionV3** backbone, ensuring mathematically meaningful predictions.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Tested on **13 datasets**, reducing:
  - **Rotation error by 41%** and **translation error by 8.8%** vs. CGAPoseNet.
  - **Rotation error by 32.6%** and **translation error by 19.9%** vs. the best PoseNet strategy.
- **Efficient and Lightweight:** Achieves these improvements with **4 million fewer trainable parameters** compared to CGAPoseNet.
